## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **PHP**: Ensure PHP is installed (version 7.4 or higher recommended).
- **MySQL**: MySQL server should be installed and running.
- **Web Server**: Apache for hosting the PHP application.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Set up your web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to serve the project directory.

3. Import the MySQL database:
   - Access your MySQL server and create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE waste_management_system;
     ```
   - Import the provided SQL schema file to create necessary tables:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p waste_management_system < database/schema.sql
     ```

4. Configure the database connection in `config.php`:
   ```php
   define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
   define('DB_PASSWORD', 'yourpassword');
   define('DB_DATABASE', 'waste_management_system');
   ```

5. Ensure PHP modules are installed for MySQL and session handling:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install php-mysqli php-session
   ```

6. Start the web server and access the application in your browser:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
